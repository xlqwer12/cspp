## PREREQUISITES

 This project requires:
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v3.1+
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.

## BUILDING

 This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
 have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
 the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
 For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

 NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
 generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

## INSTALLING

 Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute "sudo make install".

## CONTRIBUTING

 TODO: Enhance section.
